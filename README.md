Transformer Anti-Theft System. This is an IoT project that seeks to solve the problem of Transformer vandalism. Was designed for Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) so as to protect their Electricity Transfomers from anywhere in the world. Ideally it has to own by both Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) and (ZRP) or the police for obvious reasons.
